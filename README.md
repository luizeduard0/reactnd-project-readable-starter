# Readable App
Readable is a simple app that allow you to create posts. Users will be able to comment on your posts.

## How-to
After _cloning_ this repo you will find two folders: _api-server_ and _api-server_.
Go to each folder and run `npm install`

### Running The server
Go to [/api-server](/api-server) and type `node server`

### Running the app
On another terminal window (_or tab_) go to [/frontend](/frontend) and run `npm run start`.

_Note: both `server` and `frontend` needs to be running simultaneously_.
